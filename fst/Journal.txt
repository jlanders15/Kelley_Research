### FST Filtering Journal


# This document shows the work process for the fst filtering / comparing done for the 10 fish populations

# The fish populations have sulfidic and non-sulfidic conterparts which are:

# esperanza vs ixta
# pso vs bonita
# lluvia vs vg
# gloria vs vs 
# banos vs rosita

# First, the raw population vcf files were combined using bedTools

###

file1="file_name1.vcf.gz"
file2="file_name2.vcf.gz"

bcftools merge $file1 $file2 --output ../vcf_output/02.23.20/file1.file2.vcf

###


# The output files were gzipped to save space

# Text files were created with all of the names of the individuals for each population, which are provied in this repository

# Using vcfTools, a Weir and Cockerham fst estimate comparing the pairs of complemetary populations

###

vcftools --gzvcf mergefst --weir-fst-pop textFile1 --weir-fst-pop textFile2 --out fst/jake.pop1.pop2.fst


# files were large, ~20gb. May need to filter the vcf before doing fst, or explore fst filtering options
